# Handwritten IOC Container

This project is a **handwritten IOC (Inversion of Control) container**, created to explore and understand how IOC containers work and why they are crucial in modern software development. It combines the implementation with the latest **.NET 8 attribute-based programming features**, offering an educational approach to the topic.

## üöÄ Features
- **Manual Implementation**: A step-by-step exploration of the internals of an IOC container.
- **Dependency Injection**: Automatically resolves dependencies for registered services.
- **Attribute-Based Configuration**: Utilizes .NET 8's attributes to streamline service registration.
- **Educational Focus**: Built to provide a deeper understanding of IOC principles and concepts.

## ‚ùì Why Create This?
While frameworks like ASP.NET Core provide built-in IOC containers, building one from scratch offers several benefits:
- **Understand the Basics**: Learn how service registration and resolution work under the hood.
- **Demystify IOC**: Understand why IOC containers are necessary for improving code modularity, maintainability, and adherence to SOLID principles.
- **Hands-on Experience**: Experiment with custom logic and explore .NET 8's latest features.
